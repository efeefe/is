# reuse.city

![Bin it!](https://github.com/opendott-smartcities/II/raw/main/prototyping/reuse.city/images/P1000012.jpg)

Hi. I am [Felipe Schmidt Fonseca](https://is.efeefe.me), a PhD researcher in the [OpenDoTT project](https://opendott.org) (Northumbria University / Mozilla Foundation). My current [research questions](https://is.efeefe.me/opendott/questions) revolve around waste prevention through practices of reuse.

In this page you can find current information about my current efforts to co-design and prototype technologies and other measures to promote the reuse of goods and materials in contemporary cities. In previous research activities I found that one critical point lies in the ability to assess the potential value of discarded materials. At the moment I am adopting a speculative approach towards potential uses of digital technologies to provide aid on that matter.

Everyday documentation about my research is to be found on [this git repository](https://github.com/opendott-smartcities/II/). More general research progression will be reported on [this blog](https://is.efeefe.me/opendott). During four weeks of April 2021 I'm recruiting people to participate on an [online co-design lab](https://make.reuse.city) (see below) in order to develop these ideas in an open environment.

## Online co-design lab

I am currently inviting practitioners, researchers and activists to join a series of activities to take place online during the month of April 2021. I will update this page frequently to inform how you can help.

- Throughout the month - online conversations (platform/tools to be defined with participants).
- April 9th - Online Workshop.
