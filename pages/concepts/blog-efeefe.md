# OpenDoTT
## Waste Avoidance and Smart Cities

At the time of publishing this page (August 2020), I have sketched eight concept ideas, listed below and further detailed in individual pages. This list and its contents will expand or contract as my research evolves, but the rolling history of changes is kept in this website's [git repository](https://github.com/efeefe/is/tree/master/pages/concepts).

Learn more about my research focus [here](../opendott/focus).

## Design Concepts

These are attempts to respond to issues and insights identified while exploring the idea of *waste avoidance* in cities and towns, and how that can broadly relate to smart city projects.

Right now I am expecting to gather feedback on those concepts in order to verify their relevance and prioritise further phases of development.
