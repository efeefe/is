Donate and track.

===

### Description

Kerbside bins that allow citizens to donate unused objects. The equipment generates a tracking code which allows donors to learn where the objects are taken to, what is made of them and the social/economic impacts they end up having.

The Reuse Bin is the most visible interface between citizens and the [Reuse Commons](../reuse-commons). Materials are taken to [Transformation Labs](../transformation-lab) to be assessed and acted upon. All data generated along the process is fed into the [Reuse Dataset](../reuse-dataset).

### Open Questions

- How to integrate with municipal waste management?
- Who is in charge of collecting the materials?
- How do citizens interact with the bin? A rugged screen? Smartphone app? Paper slips for the tracking code?

### Target Groups

1. Citizen / Household
1. Community Reuse
1. Council / Local Authority
