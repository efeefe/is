Open Dataset about different kinds of reuse of materials in urban environments.

===

### Description

There is strong evidence that often times recycling is not the most appropriate solution for waste, Particularly when there are still potential uses for the discarded materials. However, there is little available data to inform society of the social, economic and environmental outcomes of reuse.

The Reuse Dataset will integrate and make available data about different kinds of reuse of materials in urban environments, including household, community and local initiatives. It is an important element to build the [Reuse Commons](../reuse-commons).

### Open Questions

### Sketches

### Target Groups

1. Council / Local Authority
1. Community Reuse

### Supporting Research Data

### References

#### Repair dataset

> The Restart Project, on behalf of the (Open Repair) Alliance, led on collecting updated versions of all datasets and combining them. This involved preparing them for aggregation, separating data about non-electrical products collected by some of the partners, and finally publishing the combined dataset as well as the individual sets from all partners.
