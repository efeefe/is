The pages listed below show eight concept ideas emerging from my research within the [OpenDott](../) project. They are attempts to respond to issues identified while exploring the idea of *waste avoidance* in cities and towns, and how that can broadly relate to smart city projects.

Right now I am expecting to gather feedback on those concepts in order to verify their relevance and prioritise further phases of development. I will update the concepts as they turn into co-design concepts.
