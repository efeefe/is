An open database about objects, to support the reuse (repair, recirculation, upcycling) and help evaluate the potential of objects for secondary markets.

===

### Description

The Universal Registry of Things is a trusted source of information about how to reuse objects. It covers information about repair, customisation and repurposing of virtually any kind of thing.

Examples of data to be featured:

* Manufacturer
* Support and end-of-life policy;
* Versions and official recalls;
* Price of object offered online (new/used);
* Materials;
* Service manuals;
* Parts;
* Repair tools;
* Tutorials of repair and upcyling;
* Examples of reuse;
* How to dispose of.

#### Relation to other concept ideas

The Universal Registry of Things provides the information groundwork for the [Point and Reuse](../point-reuse) app, as well as having indirect connections both to [Save this Thing](../save-this-thing) and

### Open questions

* Who is responsible for maintaining the database? Is it an organisation? A consortium of interested parties?
* Is it relevant to set it up as a blockchain? Or a decentralised database / open protocol?
* What are the risks involved? Copyright infringement, restricted materials etc.

#### eBay What it's Worth

eBay is often used by both businesses and volunteer groups operating in secondary markets to evaluate products. *What it's worth* is a web service to make that easier.

#### Thingiverse

While essentially different in purpose, Thingiverse is another database of objects that can be used to benchmark ideas for the Universal Registry of Things.

>  MakerBot's Thingiverse is a thriving design community for discovering, making, and sharing 3D printable things. As the world's largest 3D printing community, we believe that everyone should be encouraged to create and remix 3D things, no matter their technical expertise or previous experience. In the spirit of maintaining an open platform, all designs are encouraged to be licensed under a Creative Commons license, meaning that anyone can use or alter any design.
