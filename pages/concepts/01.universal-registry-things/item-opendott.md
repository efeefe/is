### Description

An open database collecting and making available different data about objects, in order to support the reuse (repair, upcycling) and help evaluate the potential of objects for secondary markets.

===

Examples of data to be listed:

* Manufacturer
* Versions
* Price of object offered online (new/used)
* Materials
* Service manuals
* Parts
* Repair tools
* Tutorials of repair and upcyling
* Examples of reuse
* How to dispose of

### Open questions

* Who is responsible for maintaining the database? One organisation? A consortium of interested parties?
* Is it relevant to set it up as a blockchain? Or a decentralised database / open protocol?
* What are the risks involved? Copyright infingement, restricted materials etc.

### Supporting Research Data

> "to be honest, eBay has been probably the main way of valuing stock. You can type in the specs of a laptop into eBay, you can click on sold listings, and you can see what a similar type product has sold for over the last week or month."
