## About me

I am Dr. Felipe Schmidt Fonseca, an experienced Berlin-based Brazilian advocate for social-environmental innovation and free/open-source technologies turned researcher. I am the founder of [Reuse City studio](https://reuse.city) and a co-creator of [semente](https://semente-de.github.io/), a toolkit for community projects; as well as the co-founder and lead articulator of the [Tropixel](https://tropixel.org) network; and an active member of organisations such as [GIG](https://globalinnovationgathering.org/) and [Circular Berlin](https://circular.berlin/).

Between 2019 and 2022, I was a Marie Curie Early Stage Research Fellow ([University of Dundee](https://dundee.ac.uk/) / [Northumbria University](https://northumbria.ac.uk) / [Mozilla Foundation](https://foundation.mozilla.org/)). I have recently engaged in collaborations such as [ID21](../stuff/id21-briefing), [fonte.wiki](https://fonte.wiki), [ALGO-BR](https://globalinnovationgathering.org/algoracism/), and [CODE](../stuff/exactitude-maps).

I have a [PhD in Design](../opendott) from [Northumbria University](https://northumbria.ac.uk) (Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK). The title of my thesis successfully defended in September 2023 is "[Generous cities â€“ weaving commons-oriented systems for the reuse of excess materials in urban contexts](https://wiki.reuse.city/opendott)". Before that I got an [MA in Scientific and Cultural Dissemination from Labjor](http://www.labjor.unicamp.br/) at the University of Campinas (UNICAMP) in Brazil, acquired with a [dissertation about networked experimental labs](https://redelabs-org.github.io/livro/redelabs-laborat%C3%B3rios-experimentais-em-rede-2014).
