title: Craft in Qatar
---

Our field trip took us to a neighbourhood to visit repairers, woodworkers, and tailors. Some of them agreed to talk to the group of students about their trade, background and worldview. I had an experience completely detached from what other foreigners typically have in Qatar, with the high rises and shopping malls.

Most of the repairers seemed to be over 50 years old, often more. My photos don't show it that much, but important characters of the visit were their hands. And their tools and equipment. The student's pictures collected in the [publication](../../repair-culture) show it better.

I wondered what would happen over time to those roles - along with  and their skills and lived experience - after they retire or decide to go out of business. One of the students replied "the country can bring more guest workers from abroad whenever needed". It sounds quite trivial, in a place with enough economic resources to import labour. Even fields of work that require years of experience are easily replaceable. Such renewal usually happens, however, under very strict conditions. One guy I talked to on another occasion said he had sold his car back in Bangladesh to pay for the work permit, and got the money back in a few months only.

One of the shoe repairers also said that nowadays nobody in Qatar buys handmade sandals from them, as was customary in the past. People now "drive their AC cars to the mall and buy imported sandals that look just like ours". He said that most of his income these days comes from soldiers, who are given only one pair of boots for the whole period of military service.

Here is a vide of a shoe repairer in action:
