During [my residency at VCUQ](../), I had collaborative sessions with the students and professors alongside lectures and workshops. In one of them, we decided to conduct fieldwork exploring two topics:

- What happens to discarded materials in Qatar?
- Where can craft still be found in a country with such a highly accelerated transition to a consumerist economy?

During the residency, I heard an anecdote that the Qatari government had invested in building recycling plants only to find later that they were unfeasible. There is no point in trying to sell recycled materials where manufacturing plants are rare, and shipping such materials abroad wouldn't make sense economically. I didn't find proof of any of that and assume that things may have changed afterwards. Still, I discussed with the students what they tought happened to the things they discarded everyday. Nobody had a clear idea. Someone then said they had heard (or seen on Google Maps, I'm not sure) about places in the desert where cars and tires were discarded. That was our first venture in fieldwork, and did we find dumpsites as big as whole neighbourhoods in the middle of nowhere, half-covered in sand.

For the other topic, we went looking for wood-workers, shoe repairers, tailors and other craft-based professionals. We found aging workers and little intergenerational knowledge sharing. Most of those craftsmen (all men indeed) had lived in Qatar for decades, and decided not to pass along their skills to their children. One said "my son is better off, he is a driver". Another one said "youngsters are not interested in this kind of work". Some of them still had well-maintained tools and equipment they purchased when first arriving in the country - one of them reportedly 35 years earlier.

My image collections are below. The students also made better pictures, with proper cameras. Some of them can be seen in the draft publication [repair culture](../repair-culture).
