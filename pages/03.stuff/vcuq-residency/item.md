During two weeks in 2014, I was a Designer in Residence at the Virginia Commonwealth University Qatar, in Doha. I worked with a group of students from their MFA in Design. The topic I explored was "repair studies", and how repair could relate to design, culture, and the economy.

Some outputs of the residency were:

- Images collected during [fieldwork](fieldwork) with [crafters and repairers](fieldwork/craft), [dumpsites in the desert](fieldwork/desert) (and some [psychogeography](psychogeography)), as well as a [repair cafe and some upcycling experiments](sallehlab) at the University. Most of the images were shared earlier on an [Album on Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/felipefonseca/sets/72157649068360535/) before being edited.
- The text Gambiarra: repair culture, initially published in Makery ([English](https://www.makery.info/en/2015/03/31/gambiarra-la-culture-de-la-reparation/) / [French](https://www.makery.info/en/2015/03/31/gambiarra-la-culture-de-la-reparation/?lang=fr)). An improved version was included in [Tvergastein](https://www.academia.edu/20808625/Gambiarra_Repair_Culture). A copy is kept here in [my blog](https://is.efeefe.me/stuff/gambiarra-repair-culture).
- By the end of the residency one of the professors started organising a publication with photos of the activities. I wrote a text and contributed with some images, but we never properly finished the publication. A draft, however, can be found [here](repair-culture).
- A microblog [on Tumblr](https://repairculture.tumblr.com/) during the residency (I keep a [copy here](repairculture-tumblr) to make sure it doesn't disappear).
- Interim blog posts (in Portuguese):
  - [Gambiarra Studies](https://desvio.github.io/blog/gambiarra-studies/)
  - [Chegando a Doha](https://desvio.github.io/blog/chegando-doha/)
  - [Meio-relato](https://desvio.github.io/blog/meio-relato-residencia-na-vcuqatar-em-doha/)
- Some impressions would also be published a couple of years later, in the fourth edition of Facta Magazine under the title [Gambi-sand](https://is.efeefe.me/stuff/gambi-sand) ([in Portuguese, Gambiareia](https://transformateria.wordpress.com/2017/11/30/gambiareia/)).
- Oh, and an actual story at the local newspaper:
