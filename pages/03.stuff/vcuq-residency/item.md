In 2014 I was a Designer in Residence at the Virginia Commonwealth University Qatar, in Doha. I was there for two weeks, working with a group of students from their MFA in Design. The theme of the residence was the brazilian practice of Gambiarra and how it could relate to design and manufacturing.

Some of the outputs of the residency were:

- The text Gambiarra: repair culture, initially published in Makery ([English](https://www.makery.info/en/2015/03/31/gambiarra-la-culture-de-la-reparation/) / [French](https://www.makery.info/2015/03/31/gambiarra-la-culture-de-la-reparation/)). An improved version was included in [Tvergastein](https://www.academia.edu/20808625/Gambiarra_Repair_Culture). A copy is kept here in [my blog](https://is.efeefe.me/stuff/gambiarra-repair-culture).
- Some impressions were also published in the fourth edition of Facta Magazine under the title [Gmbi-sand](https://is.efeefe.me/stuff/gambi-sand) ([Gambiareia in Portuguese](https://transformateria.wordpress.com/2017/11/30/gambiareia/).
