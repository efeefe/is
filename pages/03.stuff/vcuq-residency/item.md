In 2014 I was a Designer in Residence at the Virginia Commonwealth University Qatar, in Doha. I was there for two weeks, working with a group of students from their MFA in Design. The theme of the residence was the brazilian practice of Gambiarra and how it could relate to design and manufacturing.
