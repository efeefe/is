During my [residency at VCUQ](../), I kept a microblog on Tumblr: [repair culture](https://repairculture.tumblr.com/). Most of the posts were URLs to websites we were using in the repair event, or discussing with the students. There are however a couple of quick notes about the [Sallehlab](../sallehlab). Re-accessing that a decade later (I'm sharing this in November 2024), it's interesting to notice how some of those references would reappear many times in further stages of my work.

I made a copy of the contents and reposted below, stripped of the tags and in direct cronology. I kept the timestamps as a reminder to myself of how long I've been reflecting about these topics. Some of the URLs are unfortunately broken, which is another sign of time passing.

### Stories

Every object comes with a story. It is important to listen to the story not only to try and diagnose what the problem seems to be, but also to empathize with the object&rsquo;s owner, build trust and hopefully learn something in the way.

### Tools and testing materials

During our first repair cafe in Doha, it was worth noticing the amount of time we spent looking for the proper tools or testing devices. An organised bench should already start with some of these materials, but the preparation will never be extensive enough - so long as we can&rsquo;t tell what kinds of objects will show up.

### Repair Process - first draft

<ol>
<li>Invite people to bring their broken objects or even only to help fixing others&rsquo; objects;</li>
<li>Listen to the story of each object that arrives;</li>
<li>Prove whether it is really broken by trying to reproduce the alleged failure. If it works, return to the owner (or forward it to someone else if that was the deal);</li>
<li>Start with simple fixes: replace fuses, check whether safety buttons are properly placed and moving. If it works, return or forward the object;</li>
<li>Open it up. Screwdrivers are often of help. Some objects won&rsquo;t be opened unless you break a seal or sometimes even a part of its case. Check whether there are recommendations (service manuals, youtube videos, internet forum). If the object may be damaged, warn the owner beforehand;</li>
<li>With the object opened, try to understand its inner working. You may end up needing to stop and learn about whatever this object is built on;</li>
<li>Identify broken parts and try to replace them. This may require a visit to stores, online shopping, alternative approaches or removing parts from other objects;</li>
<li>You will often find that the object can not be repaired. If that is the case, try to make something else out of it (that will be the subject of another post soon);</li>
<li>Whatever the results are, give a destination to the object: return it to owner, forward it to someone else, use it yourself or discard it properly.</li>
</ol>
