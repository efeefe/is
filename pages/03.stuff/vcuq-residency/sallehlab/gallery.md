# Sallehlab

Sallehlab was a repair/upcycling workshop organised with MFA students during my [residency at VCUQ](../). The idea was experiment with cleaning and opening up broken or discarded things, and see what could be done with them. Many students said it was their first time doing that.

Hands and tools. Dirt and loose parts. Learning from YouTube videos. Even those highly educated students with access to fully equipped workshops and a Fablab found repairing simultaneously exciting and frustrating, with a combination of creativity and dead-ends. Upcycling was more fun, though - even more so as they were free to be more speculative than practical. Furniture and garments came out of that. One student used the 3D printer to fabricate a tool extension.
