This is a new subsection of my website I'm setting up in November 2024. It is an open-ended research journal. I felt the need to air some stuff - reflections, repetitions, rants. New stuff made anew, old stuff again and again. Re-accessing myself and our networks. Reaffirming my tiny and relatively autonomous infrastructure as the core of my writing on the internet, against the tiring social networks and their unbearable attention exploitation.

Documenting to myself: it's a blog within my GRAV-based personal website. This section, under the "stuff" collection, uses the theme [Editorial](https://github.com/pmoreno-rodriguez/grav-theme-editorial). The fbr page is set up as a "blog", and its children pages are items. I'll explore the sidebar and other features of the theme when I have time, but initially I'll be moving here some drafts from the joplin desktop app.

Let the future begin!
