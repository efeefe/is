<span style="font-family: courier, monospace;">
	We are defeated.<br />
	We are defeated.<br />
	<br />
	It is not the quality of our playing.<br />
	Not the level of our dedication.<br />
	We do not lose because we are not prepared.<br />
	We are defeated because the game exists.<br />
	<br />
	We lost before we started playing. <br />
	We lost <font style="color: red">BECAUSE we agreed to play</font>.<br />
	<br />
	We must learn that. Accept that.<br />
	And keep playing.<br />
	<br />
	And losing.<br />
	<br />
	With love and grace. Telling the story of our defeat.<br />
	For as long as we play and lose but don't give up,<br />
	we are defeated but they do not win.
