Future Beyond Repair ("FBR") is an independent research journal about materiality, regeneration, tactics, openness, and futures.

I [set up](opening-up) FBR in November 2024, with an initial collection of recent texts.  I needed to have a space reconnect to and go beyond [earlier projects](../), seeking to overcome the limitations of our ways of seeing things in these turbulent times.
