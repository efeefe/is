I collaborated with a group of brilliant researchers and practitioners conducting a "deep dive" study about the expansion of distributed manufacturing in the Global South commissioned by the UK's [Frontier Tech Hub](https://www.frontiertechhub.org/). This endeavor generated valuable insights into this crucial domain and allowed us to devise innovative strategies for accelerating the worldwide adoption of distributed manufacturing.
