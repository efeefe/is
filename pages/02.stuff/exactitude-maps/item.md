Digital representations of the physical world are built and updated in real-time as people use their digital devices to go about their lives. Even while wandering through their neighbourhood, they generate a data trail that is instantly captured and fed back into the eternal cybernetic leviathan that not only describes the physical world but also creates digital maps of behaviour, desires, and potential consumption. This collective dataset presents a valuable resource that is extracted for profit by a handful of corporations, weaponising it for explicit advertising or more subtle manipulation. *On the Exactitude of Maps* raises questions about the ownership of geospatial data in the contemporary economy, and the imbalances that emerge from their use.

The piece investigates user-generated geospatial data and its economic exploitation by international corporations. Digital representations of the physical world are built and updated in real-time as people use smartphones, computers and other devices to go about their lives. Users plan where to go and how to get there; they post and read reviews of restaurants, parks or hotels. Even when they don’t follow the recommended route to get to a place or decide not to pick the best-reviewed café, they are also generating data that is instantly captured and fed back to the eternal cybernetic leviathan that not only describes the physical world but at the same time creates digital maps of behaviour, desires and potential consumption. Such a collectively built dataset is a huge resource pile being extracted for profit by a handful of corporations. It can be weaponised for explicit advertising or other and more concealed kinds of manipulation. It is also an essential means of production for the digital economy, being used daily by precarious gig workers in industries such as ride-sharing, food apps, online shopping and platform-organised freelancing such as house cleaning, home repairs and others.
