REDE//LABS is the umbrella containing a series of projects I have developed between 2009 and 2017, with a focus on laboratories and experimental digital culture. Documentation about REDE//LABS can be found below:

- An [open research blog](https://redelabs-org.github.io/) (active until 2017) co-edited with Luciana Fleischman.
- A 3-part report about Creative Experimental Settings commissioned by the Brazilian Ministry of Culture / UNDP, co-authored with Luciana Fleischman: [mapping](http://redelabs-org.github.io/livro/minc-14/1), [context and recommendations](http://redelabs-org.github.io/livro/minc-14/2), [strategies](http://redelabs-org.github.io/livro/minc-14/3).
- My MA dissertation (2014, in Portuguese) on "[Networked Experimental Labs](https://redelabs-org.github.io/livro/redelabs-laborat%C3%B3rios-experimentais-em-rede-2014)" supervised by Prof. Rafael Evangelista / UNICAMP.
- A series of [texts](https://web.archive.org/web/20120111170706/http://arquivovivo.org.br/archives/autor/felipe-fonseca) and [videos](../redelabs-videos) (in Portuguese) commissioned by the Spanish Cultural Center in S찾o Paulo (2011-2012).

The event closed with an international panel on experimental labs (video [here](https://archive.org/details/2010-CDBR-LabExp)), with Tapio M채kel채 (FI), Barnabas Malnay (HU) and Marcos Garcia (ES).
