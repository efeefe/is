On foot. Headphones connected to the little screen. Not by chance, I listen to the soundtrack of Code 46. The heat is mild, the sun has set a few hours ago. I cross avenues of smooth asphalt and fast cars, mentally exploring the map that I avoid consulting in my pocket. Some families stroll through the park that borders the coastline and this still causes me some estrangement. Not the families themselves, except perhaps by the time. But it's the park itself that has a kind of unreal touch. Only in volume of water - desalinated, it is good to remind - these thousands of square meters of grass should consume more than entire regions of the Brazilian semiarid. Not to mention energy, tools and work. But here everything is like this.

We are on the edge between the sea and the desert. But this city does everything to hide it. One secret among so many others. On my way, some clues - human trails in this almost empty place of historical record. A magazine and a helmet next to a downtake pipe cover. The abandoned grocery cart on the curb, overturned sideways. A pair of working boots leaning against a low wall. The failure in the pavement still waiting for the bloques, reminding us that there are just a few centimeters that divide this almost scenographic city of the infinite sand.

All this artificial setting, a gigantic construction site with bright & cheery buildings throwing lasers to the clouds, new avenues and shopping malls are, in practice, produced with human hands and abilities, and the construction is far from over. People building a country that is not theirs. And neither it is for them, in a deep and clear way.

I was invited to spend two weeks here as a resident at a university. I'm working with ten students of the master's degree program in design. They are brilliant. Eight are women who flock here in search of wider horizons of study, still rare in other Arab countries.

The residence is about gambiarra and the culture of repair, a theme that in this place sounds strange. Qatar is a rich country whose current form has been built in an accelerated way, with resources from natural gas exploration. The VCUQ, my host, is actually an American university (Virginia Commonwealth University) that has a unit here in Doha. It is headquartered in the "City of Education," a local government initiative that has set up five U.S. universities here on a modern campus. Most teachers are European. They have fully equipped laboratories, a room with samples of materials (hundreds, thousands of items?) and a very complete and pleasant library.

The old king, who had abdicated in favor of his son a few years ago, already knew that natural gas would end, and wanted to create alternatives to ensure that, in the space of a few decades, the economy doesn't depend on it alone. He invested - in a very caricatural way, but let's face it - in media, technology, tourism and other areas. His wife has created an educational foundation that funds projects around the world. But the country continues to have very particular characteristics.

People here don’t pay taxes, and local citizens (about 15% of the current population) have free education and health care. The workforce for less skilled activities comes from Southeast Asia. High-level technical and administrative positions are usually occupied by Europeans and Americans, except in the gas extraction sector which is the favorite of the young Cataris and who have preference in hiring.

Combining a very high purchasing power and the low level of rooting or even affection between society and territory, the result couldn’t be different of a consumerism that reaches obsession.

A student reported that what is most done in the free hours here is to buy things. This doesn’t surprise me, just as it doesn’t differ so much from the lifestyle of many people I know in São Paulo. In Qatar, however, everything is superlative. People buy a lot but they use almost nothing. Consequently, things are compulsively discarded.

My destination today wasn’t the central market, remodelled for tourism, nor some of the international museums housed in buildings signed by famous architects, or some international hotel where alcohol is allowed in the bar. I actually went to a hypermarket of French origin that is inside a shopping mall, to buy credit for my little screen and snacks to eat at times when I have no guaranteed meals at the hotel.

The mall bothered me less than I expected. Much like similar places in Brazil, except for the huge ethnic/national and clothing diversity. Curiously, we lose by far on this topic. On the other hand, it also had the ice-skating rink, international stores, fast food, and other usual things in this homogeneous and tedious mall culture. But I've seen lots of shopping bags, and I can’t stop thinking about the fate of all these things.

At the opening of my residence, I talked with the students about trash, waste and reuse. I uploaded videos: Ilha das Flores; Buy, take out, buy; Some excerpts from Extraordinary Waste; Digital Handcraft. One student commented that here people just throw things away, but by thinking it through, this "out" doesn’t exist.

This is not a new idea, but here it becomes even more radical. In Qatar, to put out is to throw to the ruthless desert or to a disputed sea. One of the teachers told us that the country had built a plant to recycle various materials with the most advanced equipment that money could buy. But it didn't come to reality because there is no local market for recycled raw material (there is no industry). And exporting it by sea would greatly increase the selling price. Result: the recycling plant itself was also left in the desert to disappear.

In general, the entire group of students was aware of issues about the environmental impact of industrial production and the contemporary world. But even as a reflection of the dynamics of local society, this wasn't a priority in the work of any of them. To focus on these issues, we decided to do a field research stage. During the next few days, we will visit professionals related to repairs and craftsmanship: tailors, carpenters, watchmakers, shoemakers. We will also go out in search of car cemeteries and tires, located in the middle of the desert. Finally, we will do two days of Repair Cafe on campus, calling attention to these issues and creating an opportunity for the students to get their hands on.

As I walk my way back to the hotel, a slight anxiety shows itself. I am trying to find out to what extent gambiarra makes sense as a clipping of tactical creativity, disobedient solution to everyday problems and building different (and better) futures. I look around once more, take a deep breath and listen to the sound on the headphones. I see one more of those scenes that remind me of the human nature of all the work done here: a glove, alone on the sidewalk. In this place, I think gambiarra will always occupy a subordinate place. Hidden, unwanted, unrelated to decision mechanisms. But it is there yes. And it must spread throughout the world, more and more.
