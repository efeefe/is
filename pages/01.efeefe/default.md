I am Felipe Fonseca, a Brazilian activist and free/open advocate turned researcher, working on the [OpenDoTT](../opendott) project and living currently in Dundee, Scotland.

In the last fifteen years I was a co-founder and leader of a number of community and networking initiatives dedicated to critical thinking (and making) in the crossroads between culture, science, technology and society. Some examples are [Tropixel](https://rede.tropixel.org), [MetaReciclagem](https://metareciclagem.github.io/), [CulturaDigital.BR](http://culturadigital.br/), [Bricolabs](https://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/Bricolabs), Lixo Eletrônico, [Ciência Aberta Ubatuba](http://cienciaaberta.ubatuba.cc/), [UbaLab](https://ubalab.github.io/). I was the user community manager of the [Subutai Platform](https://subutai.io). I have an [MA in Science Diffusion](http://www.labjor.unicamp.br/) from the University of Campinas (UNICAMP) in Brazil, acquired with a dissertation about networked experimental labs. 

I have two kids. We love travelling, playing music and cooking.
