I am Felipe Fonseca, a Brazilian activist and free/open advocate turned researcher. In the last fifteen years I was a co-founder and leader of a number of community and networking initiatives dedicated to critical thinking (and making) in the crossroads between culture, science, technology and society. Some examples are MetaReciclagem, CulturaDigital.BR, Bricolabs, Lixo Eletrônico, Ciência Aberta Ubatuba, UbaLab. I have an MA in Science Diffusion from the University of Campinas (UNICAMP) in Brazil, acquired with a dissertation about networked experimental labs. I am married and have two kids. We love travelling, playing music and cooking.
