Some weeks ago I had my second Annual Progression panel meeting at Northumbria. Differently from the first one, this time I did not need to present my research. The panel was based on the documents I had submitted describing my progress during the second year. A public version of the documents is available from the reuse.city wiki:

The meeting, with questioning by an examiner and ensuing conversations, was agreeable and relevant. Some days afterwards I was sent this objective, albeit dry, automatic message from the University:

> Dear Mr Felipe Schmidt Fonseca
> Following your application for Progression, the Faculty PGR Committee has confirmed the outcome of your application as Approved.
> You may progress with your studies.
