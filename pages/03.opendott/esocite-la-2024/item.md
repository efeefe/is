I presented the reuse.city co-design lab at [ESOCITE LA](https://www.esocite2024.com.br/) (Latin-American Conference on Social Studies of Science and Technology) in Campinas, Brazil. It was gratifying to return to the University where I got my Master's degree, ten years ago, and reconnect with some people who were important in my career.

The full text of my submission is available in my [research wiki](https://wiki.reuse.city/opendott/public/online-codesign-lab-reuse-city).
