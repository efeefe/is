[The Upcycle](https://www.mcdonough.com/writings/the-upcycle/)

*William McDonough / Michael Braungart - 2013*

> To make the system truly work, however, manufacturers need to know what resources they have, where the resources are, and when they might be getting them back to use as nutrients in another product. Some materials currently have an ewasy path toward reuse - aluminum and paper, for example. But why not celebrrate all the technical species? Companis might conceive of a system that tracks and plans reuse for all the technical nutrients in circulation in the world.
> Nature manages the cycles of biological metabolism. Let's do the same for the technical metabolism.
> We have proposed a clearinghouse for businesses to exchange information about what technical nutrients are available and even to help each other design, manufacture, and reuse the best materials. The result would be a mutually beneficioal system between players along the supply chain. We call this an intelligent materials pool (IMP).
> The principel behind the IMP is that technocal materials - what we call technical nutrition - can be endlessly reused. If mbusinesses collaborated to reclaim the high-quality raq technoical nutrients from each other, they would be incentivized to use the highest-quality substances, since they would know they would be getting the pure raq materials back again, such as clear, food grade plastic boittles that go through recycling systems that keep them at their highest quality or umprove them, returning them for use in teh best possible conditionm, and certainly without downcycling them by amalgamating them into huybrid materials.
> As with everything Cradle to Cradle, rthe benefit of the IMP would be more than just environmental. It would be economic. Valuable materials such as alloys, stabilizares, and polymers were designed for reuse/ sime polymers can be recycled more than 90 times without losing perfornance quality, while intelligently sedigned stelel csabn be recycled endlessly. UIf they were kept in a clean system, there would be no need to mine new iron and other minerals, because the reused dsteel would remain at the same hig original quality.
> Intelligent materials pooling, a collaborative business-to-business management system for the technical metabolism - in short, a Materials Bank - would provide numerous benefits, If all products were encoded, the nutrient management companies of the IUMP might, for example, ask reatilers to please tell their supplioers to design packaging so that nutrient management could optimixze cvalue at the back end, sending that material on to a different manufacturer. Value could be monetized and exchanged. Designers would know the parameters of the packaging they were crearting. Whatever was produced would be optimizeds for the multiple parties concerned.
