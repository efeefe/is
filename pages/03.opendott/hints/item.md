Recent suggestions made by supervisors, colleagues and other parties about my research:

- Look into diary studies as a way to approach my research questions
- Blockchain registry of physical objects
- Use value / exchange value
- Libraries of things
- Levels of repair - plasters, first aid, visit to doctor, ambulance

(later, reflecting on my own: waste as disease?)
