! This post is a work in progress. This warning will be removed once I'm done editing it.

* In the [Repair Journey](https://opendott.org/repair-diaries/), I have asked a group of participants to choose an object they would like to repair or repurpose, and spend two weeks keeping a diary of how the repair (or attempt to repair) went. As I write, I’m in the final phases of getting feedback from the eight participants who signed up.

Repair Journey – Research Study

The research study will investigate ways in which materials that are broken, obsolete or otherwise inadequate can be repaired, adapted or transformed in urban contexts. In particular, the study expects to understand how the value of an object is perceived in different situations. It is part of a wider research project investigating alternatives for handling discarded materials in the city. You will be a central part of this exercise by sharing your experience on how materials can be transformed locally.

Those who choose to participate in the study will then be asked to start a repair diary of one object that is either broken, malfunctioning or inadequate. Each participant will be able to choose the object their diary will focus on. It can be an object they are interested in exploring currently or some notable experience they have had in the past. During those two weeks, participants will be asked to reflect upon the value of the object, in what ways it can be made usable and how easy it is to repair or repurpose it. Stories of failed attempts are as relevant as successful ones.

By the end of the two weeks of exploration, we will meet online for a closing workshop. During the workshop, participants will be asked to report how their journeys went, as well as to discuss what would need to be changed in the city to make the reuse of materials easier, more effective and more enjoyable. The main goal of the closing workshop is to understand what should be different in cities to allow society to reuse more of the materials they discard. Additionally, some participants may be invited to take part voluntarily in personal interviews.
