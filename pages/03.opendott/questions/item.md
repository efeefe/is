! This post will be updated every time my research questions have changed. **Current version:** September 2020, closing the first year of research.

My investigation topic is the *smart city*. I am directing my attention in particular to the *reuse of materials* in cities and towns through initiatives aimed at and run by *local actors*. It can be understood as a critical approach to the way waste management is often implemented by local governments. Instead of increasing the efficiency of waste collection and disposal (usually towards reycling, incineration or landfills), I expect to generate ideas that contribute to avoid as much as possible the very need to manage waste.

In other words, I am proposing the prevention of waste, or its avoidance, through repair and repurposing. The research entails discussions about the collective ownership, as well as local sovereignty, over discarded or unwanted materials.

### Research questions

- Can waste be considered an indicator of a city's health? In that sense, to what extent should it be hidden from public view?
- In what ways can digital technologies be used to encourage the reuse of materials in urban contexts? Can IoT be used to aid on assessing the value of discarded objects, repairing and repurposing them or making them reach people or organisations that can put them to good use?
- What would be the implications of reusing materials vis-a-vis concerns of privacy, security and health?
- What is the role of local governments in promoting waste prevention?
- How do digital technologies have to offer in terms of governance for the collective management of second-hand materials? How to relate ideas of commons, social stewardship, multi-stakeholder cooperativism and circular economy in that?
