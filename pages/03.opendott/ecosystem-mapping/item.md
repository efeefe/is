! This post is a [work in progress](#todo). This warning will be removed once I'm done editing it.

> In Ecosystem Mapping, I have interviewed people who are related (either professionally or informally) with repair reuse. The main idea was to understand how the value of discarded materials can be assessed from diverse perspectives, and what kinds of transformations, equipment and knowledge are involved.

### Design of the research study

The goal of the project was to understand how broken or discarded materials circulate in the urban context, as well as where and how they are handled and transformed. I was looking particularly into how potential value is assessed in different kinds of facilities, and what types of equipment, methodologies and data sources can aid in that. I expected to do that by interviewing managers and staff working at places responsible for solid waste treatment, as well as organisations and companies that repair, repurpose or handle donations of different types of materials.

The COVID-19 lockdown in place during the whole of my data collection period made it difficult to visit and interview staff members from waste management, as well as volunteers in charities. I managed however to interview participants who brought me a sufficiently diverse set of perspectives: a local manufacturing / design shop; a nonprofit organising zero waste initiatives; a second hand shop / cash advancer; a scrap shop with an artists' studio attached; a data scientist creating ways to visualise waste data.

### Research data

The interview transcriptions and my own notes allowed me to compose topic maps for each of the interviews, which were then juxtaposed. Some patterns emerged from those maps, which I grouped in six topic clusters:

### Topic Clusters

* Connect
  * Sources of materials
  * Transformation
  * Destination - shoppers, communities, recycling
* Urban presence
  * Workshops / Local manufacturing
  * Donate / Sell
  * Repair
  * Buy / Be given
* Systems approach
  * Business models for different actors
  * Commons governance
  * Social need - Opportunities
* Change
  * “Trending” vs. “Ethical decision”
  * Behaviour / Education / “Niceness”
  * Concrete incentives - Policy / Taxing
  * Autonomy / Sovereignty
  * Islands / Rural areas - resourceful
* Data on Zero Waste / Repair / Reuse
  * Generate / Integrate
  * Manage
  * Publish
  * e.g. charity shop refuse
* Stories / Curation / Presentation
  * Find information
  * Remove information

### To do

Still to add to this post:

- more on methodology
- short description of participants interviewed
- relevant excerpts from interviews
