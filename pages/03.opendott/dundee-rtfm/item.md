title: Dundee - RTFM

For the first year of the OpenDOTT project, I have moved with my family to Dundee, in the UK. 
Frankly, I didn't even know where Dundee was before seeing the call for applications last December.
After some loose internet searching and browsing, I found it was a) not far from Edinburgh, b) a former
industrial city whose economy was based on jute production and also known for its journalism and jam,
c) the sunniest city in Scotland (whatever that actually meant), d) infamous for drug-related problems 
in the past. I also figured that the University has about 18,000 students - which amounts to about 10% 
of the population, give or take.

That I did not find while googling was a good manual with the things you need to know when
moving to Dundee. Below I'll keep notes of what I found in the process, and how that relates
to my research topic - smart cities.

We spent two days in a hostel in the city centre, but moved soon to a guesthouse in Monifieth, outside
Dundee. I would need to commute to the University for the next four weeks.
