<p>I believe it was on one of my first supervisory meetings with Nick Taylor and Mel Woods somewhere
in August that Mel mentioned a conference being organised in Rotterdam. The title
was promising: <a href="https://www.centre-for-bold-cities.nl/beyond-smart-cities-today">Beyond Smart Cities Today</a>,
which to me echoed of <a href="http://urbanscale.org/news/2011/02/17/beyond-the-smart-city/">this 2011 blog post</a>
by Adam Greenfield. Adam's <a href="../adam-greenfield-cities">critical take on the smart city</a> has been a reference 
to my own work since I first read it (for instance, one of <a href="../../stuff/cidades-digitais-controle-protocolos-livres">my blog posts</a>
on the matter, in Portuguese). Even if Greenfield is not that interested in smart cities anymore
(which I understand and for reasons I tend to agree with), it was interesting to see that construction
reenacted, so to say. The event in Rotterdam was connected to a <a href="https://www.centre-for-bold-cities.nl/">Centre for Bold Cities</a>,
which sounded somewhat corny but still invigorating.</p>
<p>When I heard about the conference, it was already too late to send any contributions. And being in
such an early stage of my research I wouldn't have much to share, anyway. On the other hand,
I felt I needed an immersion on a wider but still critical perspective about urbanism and city planning, 
and the conference would later prove to be just the right place for that. I wrote to the organisers
asking to attend the conference, and found a welcome response. By coincidence (or rather benign synchronicity),
there would be another interesting event in Berlin just a couple days later, and that started to
look like solid plans for my first research trip.</p>
<p>Just before setting off to continental Europe, I spent a couple hours in a smart cities seminar
organised by the Dundee City Council. Even with inspiring moments, that event felt a bit like reading
an industry brochure on Smart Cities. All the usual suspects were there: cameras, sensors, waste bins, electric
mobility. It's interesting to see a medium-sized city joining the bandwagon, but I missed a more
critical perspective. Particularly in what is becoming my main topic of interest, waste.
I saw no connection being made between how the city sees waste management and the potential of community
oriented (even less community run) initiatives. To be honest, I felt some critique starting to emerge at 
some points, but still quite shy. Concerns over the public interest, but not that well articulated. Perhaps 
a little afraid to be considered a luddite take, or to rather outdated. There were 27 people sitting there. Only
5 were women. Almost all the rest of them wore suits. Unfortunately I could not stay for the Q&amp;As, as I was
on my way to Edinburgh Airport.</p>
<p>I spent less than three days in the Netherlands, always with my jotbook and a pen, then about the same time in Berlim.
