Whilst preparing to travel to Berlin next week and participate in [Transmediale 2020](https://2020.transmediale.de/program), I found by chance my [profile page in their website](https://transmediale.de/content/felipe-schmidt-fonseca-0). Curiously, I had totally forgotten of my remote participation in a panel called "Remixing Digital Cities" in the 2013 edition of Transmediale. It had been less than an year since I posted the [last of my blog posts](../../stuff/cidades-coisas-pessoas) in Portuguese about cities and technologies.
