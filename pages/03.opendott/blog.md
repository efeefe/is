[OpenDoTT](https://opendott.org) (Open Design of Trusted Things) "is a PhD programme from the [University of Dundee](https://www.dundee.ac.uk) and [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org) to explore how to build a more open, secure, and trustworthy Internet of Things". I have moved to Dundee to work at the [Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art and Design](https://www.dundee.ac.uk/djcad/) in the first stage of the programme, and by mid 2020 will relocate to Berlin.

My topic in the project is "smart cities". I am documenting here what I am reading, learning and discovering as I go deeper into my research. I will also maintain a list of links with the *opendott* tag in my [infinite bookmark collection.](https://links.efeefe.me/?searchtags=opendott).
