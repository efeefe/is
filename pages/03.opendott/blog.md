[OpenDoTT](https://opendott.org) (Open Design of Trusted Things) "is a PhD programme from the [University of Dundee](https://www.dundee.ac.uk) and [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org) to explore how to build a more open, secure, and trustworthy Internet of Things."

My topic in the project is "smart cities". I am documenting here what I am reading, learning and discovering as I go deeper into my research.
