After more than four years of work amid challenging conditions, I have recently achieved the most important milestone of my PhD research. I have successfully defended my thesis before an examination board composed of an internal examiner (Professor [Joyce Yee](https://www.northumbria.ac.uk/about-us/our-staff/y/joyce-sheau-roei-yee), Northumbria School of Design) and an external examiner (Professor [Gordon Hush](https://www.gsa.ac.uk/about-gsa/our-people/our-staff/h/hush,-gordon/), Glasgow School of Art). The sessions was chaired by Dr [Mark Bailey](https://www.northumbria.ac.uk/about-us/our-staff/b/mark-bailey/), also from Northumbria. My main supervisor Dr [Nick Spencer](https://www.northumbria.ac.uk/about-us/our-staff/s/nick-spencer/) was also present in the room.

The final title of my thesis submitted on 30/06/2023 is "Generous cities â€“ weaving commons-oriented systems for the reuse of excess materials in urban contexts". The process of defending the thesis is also called "viva" in the UK. In my case, it took the following shape: the examiners and the chair met at closed doors for about 30 minutes before me and my supervisor were invited in. I then talked briefly about my research. It was not a summary of my thesis, as the examiners had the chance to read it in full, but a short presentation highlighting its most important aspects from an academic standpoint. Then the examiners made questions about my work and I was able to respond. After about two hours of discussions, I left the room with my supervisor again while the examiners wrote a report about the viva.

The examiners recommend the University to award my degree, subject to modifications that emerged during the discussion. I have now some months to perform such modifications and submit an updated version.

Differently from what I know of Universities in other locations, the viva is not a public event. From what I heard, it is rare for a thesis to be approved immediately during the viva. This characteristic may lead to some confusion for my friends and acquaintances used to seeing the defense as an open and final moment of the doctoral studies.

For what it's worth, the discussion I had with the examiners was extremely fruitful. Instead of, as I expected, having my literature or methodology severely criticised, what I had was a positive conversation on how to make the thesis more consistent. Instead of being considered too bold or insubstantial, they recommended me to be bolder on my concept of generous cities as a way to frame regenerative ways to handle excess materials locally. My spiral-shaped methodology for developing research was also suggested to be a valid contribution for scholarship, so I will explore it a bit more on the final version.
