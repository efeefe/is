After more than four years of work amid challenging conditions, I have recently achieved the most important milestone of my PhD research. I have successfully defended my thesis before an examination board composed of an internal examiner (Professor [Joyce Yee](https://www.northumbria.ac.uk/about-us/our-staff/y/joyce-sheau-roei-yee), Northumbria School of Design) and an external examiner (Professor [Gordon Hush](https://www.gsa.ac.uk/about-gsa/our-people/our-staff/h/hush,-gordon/), Glasgow School of Art). The sessions was chaired by Dr [Mark Bailey](https://www.northumbria.ac.uk/about-us/our-staff/b/mark-bailey/), also from Northumbria. My main supervisor Dr [Nick Spencer](https://www.northumbria.ac.uk/about-us/our-staff/s/nick-spencer/) was also present in the room.

The process of defending the thesis is also called "viva" in the UK. In my case, it took the following shape: the examiners and the chair met at closed doors for about 30 minutes before me and my supervisor were invited in. I then talked briefly about my research. It was not a summary of my thesis, as the examiners had the chance to read it in full, but a short presentation highlighting its most important aspects from an academic standpoint.
