*My reading notes*

Chapter 4, **Digital Fabrication: Towards a new political economy of matter**

p. 92 

> And, above all, what they are imagining is a material production that is *ultra low-cost*. The unstated premise behind all of these visions of the future isn't merely an ecnonomy in which high-precision fabricators themselves are available cheaply. It's one in which all the inputs required to make things with them - specifically, feedstock, energy and specification diagrams - are also available at something very close to zero cost. Without access to these, one doesn't truly own the means of production, only its instruments; with them, but for labor time and amortization of the fabrication engine itself, objects might indeed be had for something close to the cost of the raw material used to make them. But feedstock, energy and specifications all need to be produced by someone, somehow, and the costs involved cannot simply be wished away.

p. 94

> At present, the great majority of digital fabricators on Earth remain sequestered in limited-access workshops like these, or still harder to get at facilities belonging to universities and private research institutions. Despite their operators' best intentions, many of these spaces still intimidate the people who would most benefit from using them, their very language, branding and framing confronting more than a few would-be users with an insuperable psychic challenge ramp. Any vision of post-scarcity utopia that is predicated on distributed, democratized production would require such sites to be not merely free and formally open but actively welcoming, and that has yet to be achieved just about anywhere.

> What's more, there's a compositional heterogeneity to most of the objects in our daily environment larger than a paperclip. A simple glance around just about any room ought to establish that most of the artifacts we encounter in everyday life are complex assemblages of ceramic and polymer, cloth and wood, glass and metal. To produce anything even as sophisticated as a toaster or a laundry cart, then, implies the need for multiple different digital fabrication engines.
> And, of course, some assembly is always required, even in an age of on-demand fabrication. The requirements of assembly labor are perhaps the ultimate brake on digital fabrication: you can cut as many precision, one-off bycicle parts as you like, but someone still needs to put them together into a safely working vehicle. That someone needs space and time, and would preferably have some sense of what they're doing.
