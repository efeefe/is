It's been over a year since I defended my thesis, or as it's called there, had my 'viva voce'. Some months later I would submit a final version, with great improvements suggested by the examiners. And on May 1st this year - a holiday in Berlin, by the way - I received by email confirmation of the PhD degree.

I posted something then, but was still waiting for the thesis to be published by Northumbria University before I shared the PDF. Or that was just an excuse to leave it to sleep for a while before I re-engaged with it and overcame the feeling that I should have done some parts differently. Now it's out anyway, so no point in hiding. Here's the link:

Curiously, it was only a couple of weeks ago that I printed a hard copy of the thesis. It's interesting to flip through it outside a screen.

For those not willing to read hundreds of pages, there's also the summary of the thesis that I posted some months ago:
