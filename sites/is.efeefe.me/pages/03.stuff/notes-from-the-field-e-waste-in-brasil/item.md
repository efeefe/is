## Abstract

As  probably  every other  country  in  the  world,  in  recent  years  Brazil  has  seen  an  immense  increase  in  the production and consumption of electro-electronics equipment, which generates, as expected, an equally large amount  of  e-waste.  However,  there  is  a  general  lack  of  information  about  health  and  environmental  issues among actors involved with the e-waste cycle, and very limited public discussion about the topic. Also, proper legislation  to  regulate  the  destination  of  all  this  material  does  not  yet  exist.  The  National  Policy on  Solid Residuals,  which  has  been  discussed  in  the  Brazilian  Congress  since  1991,  had  shown  signs  of  including  e-waste management. But the responsible working group in the Chamber of Deputies has recently decided to make an amendment to its 33rd article, dealing with the regulation of reverse logistics (take-back) and man-datory  recycling  of  special  waste,  and  no  longer  considering  electronic  equipment  as  such.  In  response  to that, the collective Lixo Eletrônico decided to publish a manifesto and open an online petition drawing atten-tion  to  the  change  in  the  bill.  The  article  offers  an  overview  of  the  situation  and  the  issues  involved  and explains  the  action  that  is  being  carried  out  by  the  Lixo  Eletrônico  Collective,  presenting  the  first  outcomes and next steps.
