Another spring in Berlin (at least in theory, though challenged by this disappointing weather), another edition of the GIG week - annual meeting of the [Global Innovation Gathering](https://globalinnovationgathering.org/), a network and organisation I'm proudly part of. The week took place in late May and was, as usual, a great opportunity to be among my kind of people.

Even though I was present when the first seeds of GIG started sprouting in 2013, it took me years to become a member. And even then, when I finally joined the association, I was neck-deep into writing my thesis. For that reason, my onboarding and engagement were slow. But steady nonetheless. Over the last few years, I joined many calls, co-wrote proposal submissions, met members and partners of GIG in different parts of the world. I'd eventually work on a first collaboration, for a project on algorithmic bias in Brazil. More recently, I became a part-time researcher at GIG, in a project I co-created and helped raise funds for.

That was the context when the GIG week started. The [first day](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/open-circular-and-regenerative-innovation-for-a-sustainable-future-tickets-1291173086459) happened at the America Memorial Library in Kreuzberg. Besides receiving and distributing many gig hugs, I had the chance to present the project I'm working on. It's called [Circular Material Valuer Curriculum](https://wiki.reuse.city/en/projects/circular-valuer-curriculum), expanding on design concepts created during my PhD research and receiving valuable contributions from GIG members and other participants.

Then we all went for three intense days at [re-publica](https://re-publica.com/en), with multiple workshops, talks, impromptu collaborations, and many interesting conversations around the [GIG Makerspace](https://globalinnovationgathering.org/2025/04/30/join-us-at-the-makerspace-at-republica-25/). I spend those days navigating through the programme, discussing possibilities and building bridges for future collaborations. And of course, having fun, fuelled by [Meta Mate](https://www.metamateberlin.de/).

Finally, we gathered for another two days of activities, first exploring the Berlin scene (I helped organise a visit to [Kollage Kollectiv](https://kollagekollectiv.com/) for GIG members). On the last day, we gathered once again to spend time together and conduct members-led workshops. I used that occasion to host an open conversation about my project, bridging different realities and collecting data to refine the construction of the curriculum.

It usually takes me a couple of weeks to process and digest everything that happens during the GIG week. I had a great time - meeting again some people that I hadn't seen in person for more than 15 years, as much as getting to know new members and partners. And let's start building next year's edition already!
