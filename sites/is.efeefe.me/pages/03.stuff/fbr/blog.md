Future Beyond Repair ("FBR") is an independent research journal about materiality, regeneration, tactics, openness, and futures.

> I [set up](opening-up) FBR in November 2024 as a subsection of my website, with an initial collection of recent texts.  It was created to hold space for reconnecting with and going beyond [earlier projects](../), in an attempt to overcome the limitations of our ways of seeing things in these turbulent times.

> Have a read at the texts here, and feel free to [contact me](/#contact-me) to discuss these and other ideas.
