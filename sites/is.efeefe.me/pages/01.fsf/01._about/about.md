## About me

I am Dr. Felipe Schmidt Fonseca, an experienced Berlin-based Brazilian advocate for social-environmental innovation and free/open-source technologies turned researcher. I am the founder of [Reuse City studio](https://reuse.city), a researcher at [GIG](https://globalinnovationgathering.org/), a co-creator of [semente](https://semente.de/), a toolkit for community projects; as well as the co-founder and lead articulator of the [Tropixel](https://tropixel.org) network. I'm also a member of [Circular Berlin](https://circular.berlin/), and a member of the Advisory Board of [Silo](https://silo.org.br/)'s Caipira Tech Lab.

Between 2019 and 2022, I was a Marie Curie Early Stage Research Fellow ([University of Dundee](https://dundee.ac.uk/) / [Northumbria University](https://northumbria.ac.uk) / [Mozilla Foundation](https://foundation.mozilla.org/)). I have recently engaged in collaborations such as [ID21](../stuff/id21-briefing), [fonte.wiki](https://fonte.wiki), [ALGO-BR](https://globalinnovationgathering.org/algoracism/), and [CODE](../stuff/exactitude-maps).
